# LearningLabs
This is my repository for learning different topics through study and, ideally, building stuff based on what I've been learning. My hope is to use this repository as a sort of accountability tool.

## Repository Structure

### [notebooks/](notebooks/)
Repo for learning Jupyter Notebooks, and using them to explain different areas I end up studying, like algebra or neural networks and stuff

### [projects/](projects/)
Building working apps using different tools I am interested in learning, or scaling up sandbox experiments I find interesting

### [sandbox/](sandbox/)
Place for experiments that are meant to focus on one or two small things, don't have to be perfect
